# The GIF-Chatbot

## Project Overview
The **Animated GIF Chatbot** is an interactive web-based chatbot designed to enhance user engagement by responding to messages with relevant animated GIFs. It creates a visually rich and dynamic user experience by incorporating custom animations, sound effects, and a responsive interface.

## Features
- **Custom Background and Parallax Effect:** A visually appealing background with parallax star animations that respond to cursor movements, creating a sense of depth.
- **Custom Cursor Animation:** The cursor is hidden, and special animations are applied for a unique user interaction experience.
- **Real-Time Sound Effects:** Sound effects play when users type in the search bar and send messages, adding an auditory layer of engagement.
- **Animated Chat Interactions:** The chatbot responds to user messages with animated GIFs that match the input text, making conversations more lively.
- **Fallback Text Responses:** If no matching GIF is found, the chatbot responds with a friendly text message.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the chatbot interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface, including animations and custom effects.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions, sound effects, and managing the chatbot's response logic.
- **Flask**: (Assumed from `app.py`) Backend framework for serving the web application.
